            <Text>
              A viral test checks specimens from your nose or your mouth to find
              out if you are currently infected with the virus that causes
              COVID-19. Viral tests can be performed in a laboratory, at a
              testing site, or at home or anywhere else. Two types of viral
              tests are used: nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and
              antigen tests.
